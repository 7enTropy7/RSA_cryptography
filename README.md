# RSA_cryptography

This project is in collaboration with https://github.com/awnonbhowmik

We have implemented a highly secure RSA cryptography algorithm in a server-client socket framework. The client's messages are encrypted on their local machine using a public key and the encrypted data flows to the server where it is decrypted using the generated private key. 
This is a prctical demonstration of the algorithm where every time a socket connection is set up, a new set of pubic,private keys are generated.
